- 👋 Hi, I’m @tylerneylon on github.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, AI, data science, puzzles, and programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about recommendation systems and large language models.
- 💞️ Contributions would be awesome in the add_docstrings repo. This is a tool to add/improve docstrings to any Python code using LLMs (eg GPT).
